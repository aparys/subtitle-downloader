2
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,280
Hunger strike?
How long has this been going on?

3
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,240
She hasn't had a thing yesterday or today.

4
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,480
- Sending meals up to her regularly?
- Yes, sir.

5
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,360
Why don't you jam it down her throat?

6
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,160
It's not that simple, Mr. Andrews.

7
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,880
I'll talk to her myself.
Have some food brought up to her.

8
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,560
Yes, sir.

9
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,240
I won't eat a thing
until you let me off this boat.

10
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,760
Come now, Ellie.
You know I'll have my way.

11
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,920
Not this time, you won't!
I'm already married to him.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,240
You'll never live
under the same roof with him.

13
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,200
I'll see to it.

14
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,960
Get it through your head,
King Westley and I are married!

15
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,480
Definitely, legally, actually married!
It's over, it's finished.

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,720
There's not a thing you can do about it.
I'm over 21 and so is he.

17
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,280
While you've been on board...

18
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,200
...I've arranged to
have your marriage annulled.

19
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,480
Annulled. I'll have something to say
about that and so will King.

20
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,880
I expect him to.

21
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,840
The vittles. Come in.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,320
I told you not to bring any food in here.

23
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,520
Now wait a minute. This isn't for you.

24
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,760
Put it down here.

25
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,520
Smart, aren't you? So subtle.

26
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,200
Strategy, my dear.

27
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,920
Was it strategy sending
those gorillas to drag me away...

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,480
...from the Justice of the Peace?

29
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,600
Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.

30
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,320
I've won many arguments that way.

31
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,600
Besides not liking him,
you haven't got a thing against King.

32
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,720
- He's a fake.
- He's one of the best flyers in the country.

33
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,280
He's no good.
You married him because I said not to.

34
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,440
You're always telling me what not to do.

35
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,480
Because you've always been
a stubborn idiot.

36
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,680
I come from a long line of stubborn idiots.

37
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,720
Don't shout so.
You may work up an appetite.

38
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,320
I'll shout if I want to!
I'll scream if I want to!

39
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,440
All right, scream.

40
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,840
Let me off this boat or I'll break
every piece of furniture in here!

41
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,440
Here, now.

42
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,440
Have a nice piece of juicy steak.
You don't have to eat it.

43
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,520
Just smell it. It's a poem.

44
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,920
Lower the boats! Catch her!

45
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,200
Come on, men!

46
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,680
She got away, sir.

47
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,680
Of course, she's too smart for you.

48
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,680
Send a wireless
to the Lovington Detective Agency.

49
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,800
"Daughter escaped again.

50
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,320
"Watch roads,
airports and train stations in Miami."

51
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,920
All aboard!
Palm Beach, Savannah, Jacksonville...

52
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,720
...New York, Philadelphia.

53
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,720
We're wasting our time.
Imagine Ellie Andrews riding on a bus.

54
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,480
I told the old man it was bunk.

55
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,120
Ticket for New York, please.

56
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,240
- Here's your ticket.
- Thank you very much.

57
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,360
Thank you.

58
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,720
What's going on here?
I'd like to use that phone.

59
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,560
Go away. This is history in the making.

60
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,080
- What?
- There's a man biting a dog in there.

61
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,400
Heel, boy.

62
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,400
I can't stand this any longer.

63
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,440
In a pig's eye, you will.

64
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,320
Listen monkey face, when you fired me,
you fired the best news hound...

65
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,920
...your filthy scandal sheet ever had.

66
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,160
You wouldn't know a newspaper story
if it kicked you in the pants.

67
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,960
I got all your copy. Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna write it in Greek?

68
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,320
I'd start a new department.

69
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,640
That was free verse,
you gas house palooka.

70
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,760
What was free about it?
It cost this paper a gob of dough.

71
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,560
And it's not going to cost us any more!

72
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,640
Gordon.

73
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,440
Did you know he reversed the charge?

74
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,280
What? Why you...

75
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,320
When you get back to New York,
you keep far away from this office.

76
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,400
You're fired. You don't work here
anymore and you never will.

77
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,120
What'd he say?

78
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,240
So, you're changing your tune?

79
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,800
You're late with your apologies.

80
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,480
I wouldn't go back to work for you
if you begged me on your hands and knees!

81
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,400
I hope this'll be a lesson to you.

82
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,120
Did we tell that baby?

83
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,040
- We don't need anymore of his lip.
- You told him, Pete.

84
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,240
I guess he knows now,
how I feel about his job.

85
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,880
I bet he does, too.

86
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,560
Is my chariot ready?

87
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,640
Your chariot awaiteth withouteth,
mighty King.

88
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,880
- Lead on, sire.
- Make way for the king.

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,760
Make way for the king.

90
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,560
Long live the king.

91
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,360
Philadelphia, all aboard!

92
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,200
Step down Marty, King is back.

93
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,600
On the rack in the back.
It's your goodbye chariot.

94
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,320
Make hams of you and scram!

95
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,120
Two thousand miles is a long trip.

96
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,520
Make yourself comfortable
with a pleasant pillow.

97
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,840
Pillow, sir?

98
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,200
Driver! If you'll be good enough
to move those newspapers, I'll have a seat.

99
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,240
Hey, wait a minute!

100
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,920
What do you think you're doing?

101
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,040
The papers. What's the idea of
throwing them out?

102
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,120
The papers? It's a long story, my friend.

103
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,600
I never did like the idea
of sitting on newspapers.

104
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,240
I did it once, and all the headlines
came off on my white pants.

105
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,440
It actually happened.
Nobody bought a paper that day.

106
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,200
They followed me all over town and read
the news off the seat of my pants.

107
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,640
A fresh guy. What you need is
a good sock on the nose.

108
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,240
Listen partner,
you may not like my nose, but I do.

109
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,640
I always wear it out in the open so...

110
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,280
...if anybody wants to
take a sock at it, they can.

111
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,440
Yeah?

112
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,320
Now, that's a brilliant answer.
Why didn't I think of it?

113
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,920
Our conversation could have been over
long ago.

114
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,160
Yeah?

115
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,800
If you keep that up,
we won't get anywhere.

116
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,520
Yeah?

117
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,120
You got me. Yeah!

118
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,400
Excuse me, lady.
But that upon which you sit is mine.

119
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,200
I beg your pardon?

120
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,760
Now listen,
I put up a stiff fight for that seat.

121
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,680
So, if it's just the same to you, scram.

122
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,120
Driver, are these seats reserved?

123
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,600
- No. First come, first serve.
- Thank you.

124
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,040
These seats accommodate two people,
don't they?

125
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,880
Maybe they do, maybe they don't.

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Thank you.

127
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,160
Move over.

128
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,920
This is a "maybe they do."

129
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,720
If you'd ask me real nice,
I might put that bag up there for you.

130
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,880
Next time you drop in, bring your folks.

131
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,400
Get some! Come on, everybody!

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,640
Hot dogs, folks!

133
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,120
Rest station, 15 minutes.
We'll only be here 15 minutes.

134
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,520
Red hot coffee!

135
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,960
Right around there.

136
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,000
Get the red hot coffee! Hot dogs!

137
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,000
Can't enjoy the ride unless you eat!

138
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,520
He got away.

139
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,760
I found myself in the middle of brush
and no sign of the skunk.

140
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,120
I don't know what you're raving about,
young man.

141
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,760
- Furthermore, I'm not interested.
- Well of all the...

142
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,440
Maybe you'll be interested
to know your bag is gone.

143
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,560
My heavens! It's gone!

144
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,160
I knew you'd catch on eventually.

145
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,000
- What am I going to do now?
- Don't tell me your ticket was in it.

146
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,520
No, got that all right. But not my money.
All I have here is $4.

147
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,640
You can wire home
for money in Jacksonville.

148
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,800
No, I can't.

149
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,560
- Yes, I guess I will.
- I'll tell the driver about your bag.

150
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,480
Thank you, I'd rather you didn't.

151
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,880
Don't be a fool. You've lost your bag.
The company should pay for it.

152
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,480
- What's your name?
- I don't want it reported!

153
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,880
That's silly.
The company will take care of it.

154
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,920
Can you understand English?
Would you please keep out of my affairs?

155
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,960
I want to be left alone.

156
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,480
Why, you ungrateful brat.

157
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,440
Board!

158
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,240
All aboard!

159
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,320
Jacksonville, 30 minutes for breakfast.

160
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,360
Only 30 minutes for breakfast.

161
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,000
Just 30 minutes. That's all. No more.

162
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,400
Read all about it!

163
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,280
I'm so sorry.

164
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,840
Silly, isn't it?

165
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,640
Why, everybody's gone!

166
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,240
Thank you for that, very much.

167
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,880
- We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
- Yes.

168
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,000
That was foolish of me.

169
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,360
Why didn't you shove me away?

170
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,480
I hated to wake you up.
You look kind of pretty asleep.

171
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,360
How about some breakfast?

172
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,240
No thank you. No, I'm going
to the Windsor Hotel.

173
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,400
Windsor? You'll never make it in time.
We leave in a half an hour.

174
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,440
No, they'll wait for me.

175
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,760
Driver, I'm going to be a few minutes late.
Be sure to wait for me.

176
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,000
Yeah?

177
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,720
Yes.

178
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,800
Where's the bus to New York?

179
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,480
It left about 20 minutes ago.

180
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,680
But that's ridiculous. I was on that bus.
I told them to wait.

181
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,320
I'm sorry, miss, but it's gone.

182
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,760
Good morning. Remember me?
I'm the fellow you slept on last night.

183
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,040
Seems to me,
I've already thanked you for that.

184
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,520
What time's the next bus?

185
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,040
8:00 tonight.

186
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,000
8:00? That's 12 hours.

187
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,640
Sorry, miss.

188
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,480
What's wrong?
Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?

189
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,920
Why are you so excited?
You missed it, too.

190
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,640
Yeah, I missed it too.

191
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,560
Don't tell me you did it on my account.

192
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,000
I hope you haven't any idea
that what happened last night is...

193
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,000
Young man,
you needn't concern yourself about me.

194
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,640
I can take care of myself.

195
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,440
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.
Here's your ticket.

196
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,240
My ticket?

197
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,280
I found it on the seat.

198
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,120
Thank you.
It must have fallen out of my purse.

199
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,040
You'll never get away with it,
Miss Andrews.

200
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
- What are you talking about?
- You won't get away with it.

201
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,560
Your father will stop you before
you get halfway to New York.

202
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,280
You must have me confused
with someone else.

203
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,560
Quit kidding. It's all over the front page.

204
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,120
I've always been curious to know...

205
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,160
...what kind of a girl would marry
a front-page aviator like King Westley.

206
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,560
Take my advice. Grab the next bus back
to Miami. That guy's a phoney.

207
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,040
I didn't ask for your advice.

208
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,760
That's right. You didn't.

209
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,120
You're not going to notify my father,
are you?

210
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,480
What for?

211
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,440
You probably could get
some money out of him.

212
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,840
I never thought of that.

213
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,440
If you promise not to do it,
I'll pay you as much as he will.

214
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,280
You won't gain a thing by giving me up.

215
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,400
I'm willing to make it worth your while.

216
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,760
I've got to get to New York
without being stopped.

217
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,680
It's very important to me.

218
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,440
I'd pay you now, only...

219
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,960
...all I had when I jumped off
the yacht was a watch.

220
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,040
I had to pawn it to get these clothes.

221
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,960
I'll give you my address.
You can contact me in New York.

222
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,400
Never mind.

223
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,920
I had you pegged right from the jump.

224
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,000
Just the spoiled brat of a rich father.
The only way you get anything is to buy it.

225
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,040
You're in a jam and all you can think of is
your money. It never fails, does it?

226
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,400
Ever hear of the word "humility"?

227
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,920
No, you wouldn't.

228
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,720
It never occurred to you to say...

229
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,520
..."Please, Mister, I'm in trouble.
Will you help me?"

230
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,080
That'd bring you down off your high horse.

231
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,480
I'll tell you something to ease your mind.

232
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,080
You don't have to worry about me.

233
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,720
I'm not interested in your money
or your problem.

234
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,760
You, King Westley, your father.
You're all a lot of hooey to me.

235
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,000
You send telegrams here?

236
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,280
I'm just fine, thanks. And how are you?

237
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,160
"To Joe Gordon,
in care of New York Mail, New York.

238
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,160
"Am I laughing. The biggest scoop
of the year just dropped in my lap.

239
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,680
"I know where Ellen Andrews is."
No, do you really?

240
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,680
Go on. Send the telegram.

241
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,640
"How would you like to have the story?
You big tub of..."

242
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,840
Mush.

243
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,080
"Tub of mush. Well, try and get it.

244
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,640
"What I said about never writing
another line for you still goes.

245
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,640
"Are you burning? Peter Warne."

246
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,480
That'll be $2.60.

247
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,600
- Send it collect.
- Collect?

248
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,920
Collect.

249
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,200
Bus leaving for Savannah, Charleston,
Columbia, Greensboro, Richmond...

250
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,400
...Washington, Baltimore,
Philadelphia, New York...

251
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:38,160
Hi, sister. All alone? My name's Shapeley.
May as well get acquainted, it's a long trip.

252
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,520
Gets tiresome.
Especially for somebody like you.

253
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,280
You look like you've got class.

254
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,920
Yes, with a capital "K". I'm the guy
that knows class when he sees it.

255
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,440
Believe you me. Ask any of the boys.
They'll tell you.

256
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,320
Shapeley sure knows how to pick them.

257
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,600
Shapeley's the name
and that's the way I like them.

258
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,480
You made no mistake sitting next to me.

259
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,240
Most girls you meet on the bus...

260
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,560
...ain't nothing to write home
to the wife about.

261
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,440
You gotta be awful careful
who you hit it up with.

262
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,840
You can't be too particular, neither.

263
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,200
What's the matter, you ain't saying much?

264
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,040
Seems to me you're doing excellently
without any assistance.

265
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,440
That's pretty good. "Seems to me you're
doing excellently without any assistance."

266
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,840
Well shut my big, nasty mouth.

267
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,720
Looks like you're one up on me.

268
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,760
There's nothing I like better
than to meet a high-class mama...

269
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,880
...that can snap back at you.
The colder they are, the hotter they get.

270
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,440
That's what I always say.

271
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,240
Yes, sir.

272
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,240
When a cold mama gets hot,
boy how she sizzles.

273
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,360
Now you're just my type.

274
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,520
Believe me, sister,
I could go for you in a big way.

275
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,600
"Fun-on-the-side Shapeley," they call me.
With accent on the "fun". Believe you me.

276
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,960
Believe you me,
you bore me to distraction.

277
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,600
Looks like you're two up on me now.

278
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,840
Hey, you.

279
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,600
- There's a seat over there for you.
- What's the idea?

280
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,080
I'd like to sit next to my wife,
if you don't mind.

281
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,600
- Your wife?
- Yes.

282
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,480
Come on.

283
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,680
Yeah. Sure, excuse me.
You know, I was just...

284
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,240
Sure. Excuse me, miss.
I was just trying to make things pleasant.

285
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,800
Excuse me, I...

286
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,280
I didn't mean anything, Doc.

287
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,400
- No offence, Doc.
- No.

288
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,280
If you promise not to snap my head off,
I'd like to thank you.

289
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,400
Forget it. I didn't do it for you.
His voice gets on my nerves.

290
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,520
What'd you do all day?

291
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,040
Ran in and out of doorways.
Trying to keep out of the rain.

292
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,640
Your clothes are all wet.

293
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,680
Here.

294
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,520
You're as helpless as a baby.

295
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,680
Thank you.

296
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,560
Here you are, folks. Cigars, cigarettes,
chewing gum, candy, magazines.

297
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,040
Here, boy.

298
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,480
- Yes, ma'am.
- A box of chocolates, please.

299
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,040
- Never mind. She doesn't want it.
- But...

300
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,640
- Of course, I do. What do you mean?
- Beat it.

301
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,680
Well, you've got your nerve. Here, boy!

302
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,320
$1.60.

303
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,960
You had $4 last night.

304
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,720
How will you get to New York at this rate?

305
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,160
That's none of your business.

306
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,800
You're on a budget from now on.

307
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,200
- Just a minute. You can't...
- Shut up.

308
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,960
- What's the matter, officer?
- Bridge washed out.

309
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,280
Looks like we can't get through
till morning.

310
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,640
If any passengers want a place to sleep...

311
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,000
...you'll find an auto camp
up yonder a piece.

312
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,360
- Where?
- Right over there. See those lights?

313
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,760
Dyke's Auto camp.

314
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,040
All right, thanks. Hey, brat.

315
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,080
Are you talking to me?

316
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,680
Yeah. Come on,
we're stopping here for the night.

317
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,760
Hey! Come on, we're all set.

318
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,200
Good evening. Hope you
and your husband rest comfortable.

319
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,440
Come on! What are you going to do,
stay out there all night?

320
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,560
Darn clever, these Armenians?

321
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,480
Yeah, it's a gift.

322
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,600
I just had the unpleasant sensation
of hearing you referred to as my husband.

323
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,760
Yeah. I forgot to tell you about that.
I registered as Mr. And Mrs.

324
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,120
You did?

325
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,520
What am I expected to do? Leap for joy?

326
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,400
I kind of half expected you to thank me.

327
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,960
Your ego is absolutely colossal.

328
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,640
Yeah, it's not bad. How's yours?

329
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,120
You know, compared to you,
my friend Shapeley's an amateur.

330
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,000
Just whatever gave you any idea
I'd stand for this?

331
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,960
Now wait a minute.
Let's get this straightened out right now.

332
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,600
If you're nursing any silly notion
that I'm interested in you, forget it.

333
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,880
You're just a headline to me.

334
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,720
A headline?

335
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,680
You're not a newspaper man, are you?

336
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,840
Chalk up one for your side.

337
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,000
Now listen. You want to
get to King Westley, don't you?

338
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,720
All right, I'm here to help you.
What I want is your story.

339
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,720
Exclusive. A day-to-day account.
All about your mad fight to happiness.

340
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,800
I need that story.
Between you and me, I've got to have it.

341
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,880
Isn't that just too cute.

342
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,760
There's a brain behind that face of yours,
isn't there?

343
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,920
You've got everything nicely figured out
for yourself. Including this.

344
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,000
This? Well, that's a matter
of simple mathematics.

345
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,240
These cabins cost $2 a night.
I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear...

346
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,240
...but the family purse won't stand
for our having separate establishment.

347
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,840
Thank you very much, sir.
You've been very kind.

348
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,520
It's all right with me.
Go on out in the storm.

349
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,480
But I'm going to follow you.

350
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,560
Yeah.

351
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,640
And if you get tough, I'll just have to turn
you over to your old man. Right now.

352
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,120
Savvy? That's my whole plot in a nutshell.

353
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,280
A simple story for simple people.

354
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,960
You behave yourself,
I'll see you get to King Westley.

355
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,040
If not,
I'll just have to spill the beans to Papa.

356
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,080
Now, which of these beds do you prefer?

357
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,120
This one? All right.

358
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,520
That, I suppose,
makes everything quite all right.

359
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,160
This?

360
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,680
I like privacy when I retire.
Yes, I'm very delicate in that respect.

361
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,320
Prying eyes annoy me.

362
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,440
Behold the walls of Jericho.

363
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,520
Maybe not as thick as the ones
that Joshua blew down with his trumpet.

364
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,040
But a lot safer.

365
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,800
You see, I have no trumpet.

366
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,200
Now to show you
my heart's in the right place...

367
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,760
...I'll give you my best pair of pyjamas.

368
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,920
Do you mind joining the Israelites?

369
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,880
You don't want to join the Israelites?

370
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,520
All right. Perhaps you're interested
in how a man undresses.

371
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,760
There's a funny thing about that.
Quite a study in psychology.

372
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,640
No two men do it alike.

373
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,360
I once knew a man who kept his hat on
until he was completely undressed.

374
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,360
Now he made a picture.

375
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,840
Years later, his secret came out.
He wore a toupee.

376
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,600
I have a method all my own.

377
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,720
If you'll notice, the coat came first.
Then the tie. Then the shirt.

378
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,200
Now, according to Hoyle,
after that the pants should be next.

379
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,560
There's where I'm different.

380
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,480
I go for the shoes next.

381
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,280
First the right. Then the left.

382
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,600
After that, it's every man for himself.

383
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,400
Still with me, brat?

384
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,280
Don't be a sucker.

385
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,160
A good night's rest will do you
a lot of good.

386
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,400
Besides, you got nothing to worry about.

387
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,320
The walls of Jericho will protect you
from the big bad wolf.

388
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:37,000
"Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?
The big bad wolf

389
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,440
"The big bad wolf

390
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,600
"She's afraid of the big bad wolf
Tra, la, la, la, la"

391
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,840
Would you mind please,
putting out the light?

392
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,400
No, not at all.

393
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,920
I wish you'd take those things
off the walls of Jericho.

394
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,640
Excuse me.

395
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,840
By the way, what's your name?

396
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,480
What's that?

397
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,360
Who are you?

398
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,600
Who, me?

399
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,440
I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night.

400
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,720
I'm the soft morning breeze
that caresses your lovely face.

401
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,480
You've got a name, haven't you?

402
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,560
Yeah, I got a name. Peter Warne.

403
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,000
Peter Warne.

404
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,640
I don't like it.

405
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,680
Don't let it bother you.
You're giving it back to me in the morning.

406
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,680
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne.

407
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,600
The pleasure is all mine, Mrs. Warne.

408
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,160
- Another message, sir.
- What is it? What is it?

409
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,040
It's from Charleston.
"Checking every northbound train.

410
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,560
"Also assigned 20 operators
to watch main highways.

411
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,360
"No sign of her yet.
Will continue to do all possible.

412
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,280
"Signed, Lovington Detective Agency."

413
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,600
It's just the same as all the others.

414
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,880
- Yes, sir?
- I said I was in a hurry to get to New York.

415
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,200
- What are we crawling for?
- I got it wide open.

416
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,360
- All right, step on it.
- Yes, sir.

417
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,080
I hope she's all right.

418
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,040
All right? Of course, she's all right.
What could happen to her?

419
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,120
- Nothing, sir.
- Then shut up about it.

420
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,880
Hello?

421
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,600
Hey, mister.

422
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,880
Hello.

423
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,080
What's the matter, you not up yet?

424
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,760
- What time is it?
- 8:00. Here.

425
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,920
It's a toothbrush, thanks.

426
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,040
My dress, you had it pressed.

427
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,640
Come on. Breakfast will be ready soon.

428
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,920
You sweet thing.
Where'd you get it pressed?

429
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,680
I'll count to 10.
If you're not out of bed by then...

430
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,400
...I'll drag you out myself.

431
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,600
- One, two, three, four, five...
- I really think you would!

432
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,360
I'm out! I'm out!

433
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,880
You'll find the showers
just behind the second cottage.

434
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,120
Outside?

435
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,680
All the best homes have them outside.

436
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,600
I can't go out like this.

437
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,480
- Like what?
- Like this. I have no robe.

438
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,200
Here, use mine.

439
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,640
Thanks.

440
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,880
Make it snappy.

441
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,280
Wait, it's not my fault. You got the sleeve.

442
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,240
- Here are my puppets.
- Thanks.

443
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,200
Where'd you say the showers were?

444
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,520
Here's a towel.

445
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,120
Thank you.

446
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,880
You're kind of little, aren't you?

447
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,280
Where's the shower?

448
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,920
Your hair's cute like that.
You should never comb it.

449
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,800
I'll find it myself.

450
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,960
Are the showers in there?

451
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,760
They ain't out here.

452
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,360
Thank you.

453
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,440
Can't a body have a little privacy
around here?

454
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,920
You want a shower around here,
you'll stand in line.

455
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,400
Hi, sister. You remember me, Shapeley?

456
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,400
Say, I'm sorry about last night.

457
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,920
Didn't know you was married to that guy.
You should've told me right off.

458
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,960
High time you got back.

459
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,520
I met some very interesting women
at the showers.

460
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,000
We got chatting about this and that.
You know how time flies.

461
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,680
Come on. Sit down.

462
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,960
My, my. Scrambled eggs.

463
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:57,440
Egg. One egg. One donut, black coffee.
That's your ration till lunch.

464
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,960
Any complaints?

465
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,440
No. No complaints.

466
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,760
I'd have cream for your coffee,
but I'd be buying a whole pint.

467
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,680
You don't have to apologise to me.

468
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,960
You don't know how much
I appreciate all this.

469
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,840
What makes you so disgustingly
cheerful this morning?

470
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,360
Must be the spring.

471
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,600
I thought maybe "believe you me"
told you some more snappy stories.

472
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,840
No. He apologised for last night.
Said he didn't know we were married.

473
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,920
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be.

474
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,560
- Donut?
- Thanks.

475
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,000
You think this whole business is silly?

476
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,440
Running away and all.

477
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,160
No. Makes too good a story.

478
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,680
Yes, you do.
You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat.

479
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,320
Perhaps I am.
Although, I don't see how I can be.

480
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,640
Spoiled people are used to
having their way.

481
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,360
I never have. On the contrary.

482
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,400
I've always been told what to do and how
to do it and when and with whom.

483
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,680
Can you believe, this is the first time
I've ever been alone with a man?

484
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,880
Yeah.

485
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,040
It's a wonder I'm not panic-stricken.

486
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,920
You're doing all right.

487
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,120
Thanks.

488
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:06,680
Nurses, governesses, chaperones,
even bodyguards. It's been a lot of fun.

489
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,080
One consolation,
you can never get lonesome.

490
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,240
It has its moments. It's become a sort of
game, trying to outwit father's detectives.

491
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,120
I did once. Actually went shopping
without a bodyguard.

492
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,920
It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral.

493
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,920
It didn't last long,
they found me in a department store.

494
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,960
I was so mad, I ran out the back way
and jumped into the first car I saw.

495
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,400
Guess who was in it?

496
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,760
Santa Claus?

497
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,080
Ghandi?

498
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,080
King Westley was in it.

499
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,160
- Is that how you met him?
- Yes.

500
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,280
We rode around all afternoon.
Father was frantic.

501
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,360
By 6:00,
he was having all the rivers dragged.

502
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,080
Where'd you learn to dunk,
in finishing school?

503
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,560
Now don't you start telling me
I shouldn't dunk.

504
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,920
Of course you shouldn't.
You don't know how.

505
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,360
Dunking is an art. Don't let it soak so long.
A dip and sock, into your mouth.

506
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,080
You leave it in too long,
it gets soft and falls off.

507
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,600
It's all a matter of timing.
I'll write a book about it.

508
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,920
Thanks, professor.

509
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,600
Just goes to show you. $20 million,
and you don't know how to dunk.

510
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,760
I'd change places with
a plumber's daughter any day.

511
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,200
How do I know who you are?
I never saw you before.

512
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,720
You can't go around bothering my tenants.
There's no girl by that name here.

513
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,040
How do I know you're detectives?

514
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,120
Show him your credentials, Mac.

515
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,680
Detectives.

516
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,680
That's father at work. Peter, what'll I do?

517
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,400
Maybe I can jump out of the window.
They won't see me.

518
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,920
Get yourself all mussed up.

519
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,680
Get your hair down over your eyes
and undo your buttons.

520
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,280
I got a letter from Aunt Bella last week.

521
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,720
She said if we don't stop over
in Wilkes-Barre, she'll never forgive us.

522
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,360
What are you talking about?

523
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,880
The baby's due next month.
They want us to come.

524
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,000
She saw your sister on the street
the other day. Said she's looking swell.

525
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,320
Come in.

526
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,040
I hope Aunt Bella has a boy, don't you?

527
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:06,000
Grandma says it's gonna be a girl.
She hasn't missed calling one in years.

528
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,520
Man here to see you, sweetheart.

529
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,320
Who, me? You wanna see me?

530
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,720
What's your name?

531
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,120
- Are you addressing me?
- Yeah. What's your name?

532
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,120
Wait a minute.
That's my wife you're talking to.

533
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,880
What do you mean coming here?
What do you want?

534
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,160
- We're looking for somebody.
- Fine, but don't come busting in here.

535
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,280
This isn't a public park.

536
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,080
I got news to take a sock at you.

537
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,160
- Take it easy.
- The men are detectives.

538
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,320
Even if they're the
whole police department...

539
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,560
...they can't bust in here,
questioning my wife.

540
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,280
Don't get so excited.
He asked you a simple question.

541
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,960
Is that so? How many times
have I told you not to butt in?

542
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,080
You don't have to lose your temper!

543
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,280
As usual. Every time I try to protect you.

544
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,320
At the elks dance,
when that big Swede hit on you.

545
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,600
He did not! I told you a million times.

546
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,320
He kept pawing you
all over the dance floor.

547
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,960
He didn't. You were drunk.

548
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,760
Nuts! Just like your old man.

549
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,440
Once a plumber's daughter,
always a plumber's daughter.

550
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,560
There ain't an ounce of
brains in your family.

551
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,360
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough!

552
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,400
- Shut up!
- You see what you've done?

553
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,160
Sorry, but you see,
we've gotta check up on everybody.

554
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,320
We're looking for a girl
named Ellen Andrews.

555
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,280
Daughter of that big Wall Street mogul.

556
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,760
Too bad you're not looking for
a plumber's daughter.

557
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,280
Quit bawling!

558
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,040
I told you they were a perfectly
nice married couple.

559
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,120
You weren't bad, jumping in like that.

560
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,800
- You've got a brain.
- You're not so bad, yourself.

561
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,720
We could start a two-people
stock company.

562
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,440
Things get tough,
we'll play to small town auditoriums.

563
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,720
We'll call this one, "The Great Deception."

564
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,120
What about "Cinderella" or
a real hot love story?

565
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,320
No, too mushy.

566
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,120
I like mushy stuff.

567
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,280
Quit bawling!

568
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,640
Bus leaves in five minutes!

569
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,920
- What?
- Your bus leaves in five minutes.

570
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,640
Holy smoke, we're not even packed yet.

571
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,720
I'm starting to think
you couldn't find your way home.

572
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,040
This is the last session...

573
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,960
- Yeah?
- Telegram for you.

574
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,400
- Bring it in.
- Another wire from Peter Warne.

575
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:20,040
Warne? Throw it in the wastebasket.
Wait a minute. What does it say?

576
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,440
"Have I got a story. Stop.
It's getting hotter and hotter. Stop.

577
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,520
"Hope you're the same."

578
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,640
- Collect?
- Yes.

579
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,320
- If you accept another one, you're fired.
- Yes, sir.

580
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,640
And that gives me an idea for all of you.

581
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,880
I want action, Lovington, action.

582
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,760
- We can't do the impossible.
- It isn't impossible.

583
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,520
She's somewhere between here and Miami.
I want her found.

584
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,200
- I put extra men on, the whole way.
- That's not enough.

585
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,560
Send in Clark and Brown.

586
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,000
- You sure she isn't with King Westley?
- No.

587
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,800
He's being trailed 24 hours a day.

588
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,360
He can't even get a phone call
we don't know about.

589
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,440
I'm worried. After all,
something might have happened to her.

590
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,560
I don't think so.

591
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,640
Brown, arrange a radio broadcast.

592
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,920
Coast-to-coast hook up.
Offer a reward of...

593
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,240
...$10,000 for information
on her whereabouts.

594
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,120
Clark, send the story
to all of the newspapers.

595
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,800
Some out-of-town papers
may not have a picture of her.

596
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,120
Wire this to them.
I want the story to break right away.

597
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,200
Now we'll get some action!

598
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,040
Fine, that's fine.

599
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:57,280
You know that one
about the man who flew on the trapeze?

600
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,360
Yeah.

601
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,200
"Once I was happy
but now I'm forlorn

602
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,800
"Like an old coat
that is tattered and torn

603
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,640
"Left in this wide world
to weep and to mourn

604
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,600
"Betrayed by a maid in her teens

605
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,920
"This maid that I loved
she was handsome

606
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,280
"And I tried all I knew how to please

607
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,120
"But I never could please her
one-quarter so well

608
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,120
"As the man on the flying trapeze

609
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,800
"He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

610
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,560
"The daring young man
on the flying trapeze

611
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,240
"His actions are graceful,
all the girls he does please

612
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,040
"And my love he has stolen away"

613
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,480
I know the second verse there.

614
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,160
"Now he'd play with a miss
like a cat with a mouse

615
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,720
"His eyes would undress
every girl in the house

616
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:15,240
"Perhaps he is better described as a louse
And still people came just the same

617
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,120
"Now he smiles from the bar
on the people below

618
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,280
"And one night he smiled on my love

619
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,760
"She blew him a kiss

620
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,800
"And she hollered bravo
And he hung by his schnozzle from above

621
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,320
"He floats through the air
with the greatest of ease

622
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,800
"Daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful

623
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:45,800
"All the girls he does please
And my love he has stolen away"

624
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,320
Do you mind if I take the third one?

625
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,960
"I wept and I whimpered
I simpered for weeks

626
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,600
"While she spent her time
with the circus' freaks

627
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,480
"The tears were like hailstones
that rolled down my cheeks

628
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,600

00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:13,480

00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,920

00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:20,440

637
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,800
- Everybody keep your seats.
- Thank the man for me, Peter.

638
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,200
It's the first comfortable position
I've been in all night.

639
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,320
"She flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

640
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,960
"The daring young..."

641
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,160
What's the matter with you?
Somebody help.

642
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,800
Something happened to her.

643
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,480
Look how pale she is.

644
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,480
Let's give her a chance to snap out of it.

645
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,800
Don't worry. She'll be all right.

646
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,240
We ain't ate nothing since yesterday.

647
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,960
What happened to your money?

648
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,320
Ma spent it all on the tickets.
We didn't know it was gonna be so much.

649
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,400
We shouldn't have come, I guess.

650
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
But Ma said there was a job
waiting for her in New York...

651
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,560
...and if we didn't go, she might lose it.

652
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,760
She'll be all right
when she's had something to eat.

653
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:51,600
The next time we come to,
you buy some food. Now come on.

654
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,120
I shouldn't ought to take this.
Ma'll get mad.

655
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,200
Don't tell her.
You don't want her to get sick again.

656
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,160
No, but you might need it.

657
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,120
Come on.

658
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,240
I got millions.

659
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,120
Here.

660
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,320
- Thanks.
- Come on, go back.

661
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,760
Better phone for some help.

662
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,760
Go phone if you want to.
The nearest town is 10 miles away.

663
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,000
Yeah?

664
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,520
Say, buddy.
Like to take a look at my paper?

665
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,480
Travelling like this, you lose track
of what's going on in the world.

666
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,800
Take that story there, for instance.

667
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,560
If I was to see that dame,
you know what I'd do?

668
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,720
No.

669
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,880
I'd go fifty-fifty with you.

670
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,160
Why?

671
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,960
Because I don't believe in hogging.

672
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,200
A bird that figures that way
always ends up behind the eight ball.

673
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,960
That's what I always say.

674
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,520
What's on your mind?

675
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,880
Five G's or I crab the works.

676
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,640
Let's get away from here
and talk this over privately.

677
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,160
I knew she wasn't your wife all the time.

678
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,080
Lucky thing, my running into you.
Just the man I need.

679
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:22,320
- You made no mistake, believe me.
- I can use a smart guy like you.

680
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,840
- When you're talking to old man Shapeley...
- Can you make a gat?

681
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,080
Huh?

682
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,480
A gat. A rod.

683
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,920
- Got any fireworks on you?
- No.

684
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:37,000
I got a couple of machine guns
in my suitcase. I'll give you one of them.

685
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:40,080
May have trouble up north.
Have to shoot it out with the cops.

686
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,480
If you manage, those five G's
are as good as in the bag. Maybe more.

687
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,760
I'll talk to the Killer, he'll take care of you.

688
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,840
Killer?

689
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,560
Yeah. The big boy. The boss of the outfit.

690
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,080
You're not kidnapping her, are you?

691
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:55,800
What else, stupid? You don't think
we're after that penny-ante reward?

692
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,520
$10, 000? Chicken feed.

693
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,280
Now listen, we're holding that dame
for a million smackers.

694
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:06,040
Say, I didn't know it was anything like this.
You see, I've got...

695
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,720
What's the matter? You getting yellow?

696
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,120
I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids.
I can't afford to get...

697
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,520
Pipe down your mug before I...

698
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,720
What are you trying to do,
tell the whole world about it?

699
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,880
Listen, you're into this thing
and you're staying in, get me?

700
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,440
You know too much.

701
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,360
I won't say anything, honest I won't.

702
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,320
How do I know that?
I got a notion to plug you.

703
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:31,480
- Why should I take a chance with you?
- Trust me, mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.

704
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,520
Yeah?

705
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,960
What's your name?

706
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,560
Oscar Shapeley.

707
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,120
- Where do you live?
- Orange, New Jersey.

708
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,160
Got a couple of kids?

709
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,560
Yes, sir. Just babies.
A little golden-haired girl.

710
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,200
- You love them, don't you?
- Yes, I do.

711
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,160
You wouldn't. You're not thinking of...

712
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,680
- You keep your trap shut, all right?
- Sure.

713
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,440
- If you don't...
- I'll keep my trap shut. I will.

714
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,400
You ever hear of Bugs Dooley?

715
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,240
Bugs Dooley? No.

716
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,720
He was a nice guy, just like you.
And he made a big mistake one day.

717
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,320
Got a little too talkative.

718
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,120
- You know what happened to his kid?
- No.

719
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,600
I can't tell you. But when Bugs heard
about it he blew his brains out.

720
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,400
That's terrible.

721
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,920
He had it coming to him.
He talked too much. I never talk.

722
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,360
I never say a word. Word of honour.

723
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,040
I wouldn't want anything
to happen to my kids.

724
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,360
Okay. Just remember that.

725
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,520
Now beat it.

726
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:28,600
Sure, mister. Thanks.
I always knew you guys were...

727
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,440
Come on, scram.
And stay away from that bus.

728
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,680
Sure. Anything you say.

729
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,960
- You wouldn't shoot me in the back?
- If you don't beat it...

730
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,240
I'm going.

731
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,600
What's wrong?
Why do we have to leave the bus?

732
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,520
Come on. Don't ask so many questions.

733
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,120
Why?

734
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,440
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have
frightened him like that.

735
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,560
At the rate he's going, he's probably
crossed two state lines by this time.

736
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,520
Why did we have to leave the bus?

737
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:18,160
When Shapeley stops running,
he's going to start thinking, isn't he?

738
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,000
I've been doing a little thinking myself.

739
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,560
The next town we come to,
you better wire your father.

740
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,560
What's the matter, are you weakening?

741
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:32,320
No. I was just thinking of you.
A starvation diet may not agree with you.

742
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,600
Did you give that child all your money?

743
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,240
I gave him nothing.
You were the big-hearted gal.

744
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,520
All the money I had was that ten spot.

745
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,400
So I've been thinking
you better wire your father.

746
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:46,800
No, sir. I started out for New York
and I'm going to get there...

747
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,200
...if I have to starve all the way.

748
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,320
Okay.

749
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,760
What is this strange power
this man Westley has over you women?

750
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,320
Here, take these.

751
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,600
- Hold on to them. Get up on that log.
- That?

752
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,240
Get up on the log.

753
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,360
I wish you'd stop being playful.

754
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:18,280
So sorry. You know, this is the first time
in years I've ridden piggyback.

755
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,160
This isn't piggyback.

756
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,320
- Of course it is.
- You're crazy.

757
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,680
I remember distinctly my father
taking me for a piggyback ride.

758
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,640
- And he carried you like this?
- Yes.

759
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,600
Your father didn't know beans
about piggyback riding.

760
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,920
My uncle has four children.
I've seen them ride piggyback.

761
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,720
I'll bet there isn't a good
piggyback rider in your family.

762
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,560
I never knew a rich man
who could piggyback ride.

763
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,200
You're prejudiced.

764
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,720
Show me a good piggy backer.
I'll show you a real human.

765
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,880
Take Abraham Lincoln for instance.
A natural born piggy backer.

766
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,360
Where do you get off with
that stuffed-shirt family of yours?

767
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,440
My father was a great piggy backer.

768
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,480
Here, hold this a minute.

769
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,520
Thank you.

770
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,640
How long does this keep up?
My feet are killing me.

771
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
This looks like the best spot.

772
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,920
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?

773
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:36,480
I don't know about you,
but I'm going to give a good imitation of it.

774
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,640
Peter?

775
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,000
What?

776
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,320
I'm awfully hungry.

777
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,000
It's just your imagination.

778
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,520
No it isn't.

779
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,520
I'm hungry and scared.

780
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,400
You can't be hungry
and scared both at the same time.

781
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,800
Well, I am.

782
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,160
If you're scared,
it scares the hunger out of you.

783
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,520
Not if you're more hungry than scared.

784
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,520
All right, you win. Let's forget about it.

785
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,240
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.

786
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:08,480
Holy smoke!
Why did I ever get mixed up with you?

787
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,200
If I had any sense,
I'd be in New York by this time.

788
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,320
What about your story?

789
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,040
Taking a married woman
back to her husband.

790
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,200
I turned out to be the prize sucker.

791
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,040
All right, come on. Your bed's all ready.

792
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,200
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.

793
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,800
- Then take them off.
- What?

794
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,960
All right, don't take them off.
Do what you please, but shut up about it.

795
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,960
You're becoming awfully
disagreeable lately.

796
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,480
You just snap my head off
every time I open my mouth.

797
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,520
If being with me is so distasteful to you,
you can leave.

798
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,520
You can leave any time you see fit.

799
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,640
Nobody's holding you here.

800
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,760
I can get along.

801
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,480
Peter?

802
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,200
Peter!

803
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,680
- What's the matter?
- I was so scared!

804
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:52,400
What's got into you? I left for a minute
to find you something to eat.

805
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,600
I know but...

806
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,680
Here, eat your head off.

807
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,200
I don't want it now.

808
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,760
- I thought you said you were hungry.
- I was, but...

809
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,120
But what?

810
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,680
I was so scared, it scared the hunger...

811
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:07,000
Holy jumping catfish.
You drive a guy crazy.

812
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,440
It's liable to get chilly before morning.

813
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,160
Better use this.

814
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,440
What are you thinking about?

815
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,880
By a strange coincidence,
I was thinking of you.

816
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,080
- Really?
- Yeah.

817
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,600
I was just wondering what makes
dames like you so dizzy.

818
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,760
What did you say
we're supposed to be doing?

819
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,040
Hitchhiking.

820
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:22,840
You've given me a very good example
of the hiking.

821
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,160
Where does the hitching come in?

822
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,640
It's a little early yet. No cars out.

823
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,800
If it's the same to you...

824
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,960
...I'm going to sit right here
and wait until they come.

825
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,680
You got a toothpick?

826
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,400
- What's the matter?
- I got hay in my teeth.

827
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,920
No, I haven't got a toothpick.
Here, I got a penknife, though.

828
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,440
Now hold still.

829
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,960
- Be careful.
- All right. Where is it?

830
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,040
All right, now hold still.

831
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,200
Here. Get it?

832
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,080
Thanks.

833
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,960
You should have swallowed that.
You won't have any breakfast, you know?

834
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,720
You needn't rub it in.

835
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,080
- What are you eating?
- Carrots.

836
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,440
- Raw?
- Want one?

837
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:24,720
No. Why didn't you get me
something I could eat?

838
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:28,800
That's right, I forgot. The idea
of offering a raw carrot to an Andrews.

839
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:32,120
You don't think I'm going around
panhandling for you, do you?

840
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,720
Have one of these.
Best thing for you, carrots.

841
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,800
I hate the horrid things.

842
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,240
I wish you wouldn't talk so much.
Now we let a car get away.

843
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,680
And suppose nobody stops for us?

844
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:48,200
They'll stop all right. It's a matter
of knowing how to handle them.

845
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,880
And you're an expert I suppose.

846
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,680
Expert. And I'll write a book
about it. Call it "The Hitchhiker's Hail."

847
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,520
There's no end to your accomplishments,
is there?

848
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,560
- You think it's simple?
- No.

849
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,720
Well, it is simple.
It's all in that old thumb, see?

850
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,920
Some people do it like this. Or like this.

851
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,040
All wrong. Never get anywhere.

852
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,160
The poor things.

853
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:12,840
But that old thumb never fails.
It's all a matter of how you do it, though.

854
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,320
Now you take No. 1, for instance.

855
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,000
That's a short jerky movement, like this.
That shows independence.

856
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,640
You don't care if they stop or not.
You got money.

857
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:24,840
- Clever.
- No. 2, that's a little wider movement.

858
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,160
Smile goes with this one, like this.

859
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,720
That means you got a brand-new story
about the farmer's daughter.

860
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,280
You figured that out all by yourself?

861
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,920
That's nothing. No. 3, that's a pip.
That's the pitiful one.

862
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,560
When you're broke and hungry,
everything looks black.

863
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:45,360
It's a long sweeping movement like this.
Gotta follow through, though.

864
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,880
That's amazing.

865
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:51,280
But it's no good,
if you haven't got a long face to go with it.

866
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,640
Here comes a car.

867
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,200
Okay. Now watch me.
I'm gonna use No. 1.

868
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,360
Keep your eye on that thumb, baby,
and see what happens.

869
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,880
I still got my eye on the thumb.

870
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:08,880
Something must have gone wrong.
I'll try No. 2.

871
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,120
When you get to 100, wake me up.

872
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,960
I don't think I'll write that book after all.

873
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,440
Think of all the fun you had, though.

874
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,880
You mind if I try?

875
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,640
You?

876
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,600
Don't make me laugh.

877
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,400
You're such a smart aleck.
Nobody knows anything but you.

878
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,720
I'll stop a car and I won't use my thumb.

879
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,760
What are you gonna do?

880
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,000
It's a system all my own.

881
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,360
Aren't you going to give me a little credit?

882
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,840
What for?

883
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:44,800
I proved once and for all that
the limb is mightier than the thumb.

884
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,840
Why didn't you take off all your clothes?
You could have stopped 40 cars.

885
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:51,280
I'll remember that when we need 40 cars.

886
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,480
So, you're just married?
That's pretty good.

887
01:01:55,680 --> 01:02:00,680
But if I was young, that's the way
I'd spend my honeymoon. Hitchhiking.

888
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:05,040
Yes, sir. "Hitchhiking down the highway

889
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:08,960
"Of love on a honeymoon

890
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:11,840
"Hitchhiking down the highway, down"

891
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,520
Aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?

892
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,640
Tonsil? Me? No.

893
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:33,000
Me burn a tonsil? "My tonsils won't burn"

894
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,520
All right, let it go.

895
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:37,920
"Turn"

896
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,360
How about a bite to eat?

897
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,960
- That would be lovely.
- No thanks, we're not hungry.

898
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,120
Young people in love are never hungry.

899
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,000
No.

900
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,760
"Young people in love

901
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:00,640
"Are very seldom hungry

902
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,000
"People in love are very seldom hungry"

903
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,880
What were you going to do?
Gold dig that guy for a meal?

904
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:13,120
Sure, I was. No fooling, I'm hungry.

905
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:14,960
Eat a carrot.

906
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:16,680
No.

907
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,280
I'm going in to ask him.

908
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,360
You do and I'll break your neck.

909
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,520
Come on, let's get out of here.
Stretch our legs.

910
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,160
I'm sorry...

911
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:04,080
That's all right.

912
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,520
Hey! Come here!

913
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,680
You've got my suitcase!

914
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,800
What happened to you? I was worried.

915
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,080
- Get in.
- Look at your face! You've got a cut!

916
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,000
Well, what happened?

917
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:51,600
A road thief. Picks people up,
runs off with their things. What a racket.

918
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,040
How'd you get the car?

919
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:56,160
I gave him a black eye for it
and had to tie him up to a tree.

920
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,960
Can't be much gas left in this thing.

921
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,440
Gotta start promoting some.

922
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,080
Better take the things out
of the pocket of that coat.

923
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,840
That'll be good for ten gallons.

924
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,880
I haven't changed my mind, Westley.
I want you to understand that.

925
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:18,520
I don't like you. Never have. Never will.

926
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,440
Now that's clear enough, isn't it?

927
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:23,080
You've made it evident
by your threats of annulment.

928
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:24,920
It hasn't worried me for a minute.

929
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,440
Ellie and I got married
because we love each other.

930
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:31,240
She's proving it. As far as I'm concerned,
there's going to be no annulment.

931
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:36,320
I see. You've got hold of a good thing
and you're going to hang on to it?

932
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:41,680
All right, you win.
I'll just have to get used to you.

933
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:45,760
I admit, I'm licked.
But it's only because I'm worried.

934
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:50,080
If I don't find her soon, I'll go crazy.

935
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:53,920
I could have helped if it hadn't been
for you. I've been watched so closely...

936
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:59,000
I know. Well, you can help now.
I've got a room full of reporters in there.

937
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,560
Now, I want you to make a statement.

938
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:05,400
Say that we've talked things over
and come to an understanding.

939
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:09,000
And that if she returns
I won't interfere with your marriage.

940
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,840
- All right?
- Yeah, that's quite all right.

941
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,000
Okay.

942
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,800
I hope you and your wife
spend a pleasant week with us.

943
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,280
So do I. Thank you. Goodnight.

944
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:29,680
Goodnight.

945
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:33,720
- All right, brat.
- Any luck?

946
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,440
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us
have a cabin.

947
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,840
What about the money?

948
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,040
I talked him out of that idea.
He thinks we're staying a week.

949
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:43,760
- I must think something up before morning.
- That's swell.

950
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:48,440
Yeah? I'm glad you think so.
If you ask me, I think it's foolish.

951
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:53,480
I told you there's no use in staying here.
We can make New York in three hours.

952
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:59,840
I thought you were in a hurry to get back.

953
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:08,040
Whoever heard of getting in
at 3:00 in the morning?

954
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,680
Everybody will be asleep.

955
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:18,640
Okay. Cottage no. 6.

956
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:47,840
There you go, trusting people again.
How many times did I tell you...

957
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,240
But he looked like a nice,
upright young fellow, Ma.

958
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,080
We're on the last lap.

959
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,160
Tomorrow morning,
you'll be in the arms of your husband.

960
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,400
Yeah.

961
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,360
You'll have a great story, won't you?

962
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:14,200
Yeah. Swell.

963
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:36,960
Thanks.

964
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,920
We certainly outsmarted your father.

965
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,360
I guess you ought to be happy.

966
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,280
Am I going to see you in New York?

967
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,720
Nope.

968
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,160
Why not?

969
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:30,680
I don't make it a policy
to run around with married women.

970
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:34,800
There's no harm in your coming to see us.

971
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:37,680
Not interested.

972
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,120
Won't I ever see you again?

973
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,040
What for? I've served my purpose!

974
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:49,720
I brought you back to King Westley.
That's what you wanted, wasn't it?

975
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:26,600
Have you ever been in love, Peter?

976
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,240
Me?

977
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:31,560
Yes.

978
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,920
Haven't you ever thought about it at all?

979
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:42,000
It seems to me you could make
some girl wonderfully happy.

980
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:46,760
Sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't?

981
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:53,080
If I could ever meet the right sort of girl.

982
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,120
Where are you gonna find her?

983
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,520
Somebody that's real.
Somebody that's alive.

984
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,680
They don't come that way anymore.

985
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,320
Have I ever thought about it?

986
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:11,920
I've even been sucker
enough to make plans.

987
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:21,960
I saw an island in the Pacific once.
Never been able to forget it.

988
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,000
That's where I'd like to take her.

989
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,480
She'd have to be the sort of a girl...

990
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:35,120
...who'd jump in the surf with me
and love it as much as I did.

991
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:45,720
Nights when you,
the moon and the water all become one.

992
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:49,920
You feel you're part
of something big and marvellous.

993
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:54,640
That's the only place to live.

994
01:12:55,720 --> 01:13:00,360
The stars are so close overhead you feel
you could reach up and stir them around.

995
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,920
I've been thinking about it.

996
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:12,880
Boy, if I could ever find a girl
who was hungry for those things.

997
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,920
Take me with you, Peter.
Take me to your island.

998
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,640
I want to do all those things
you talked about.

999
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,040
You better go back to your bed.

1000
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:33,200
I love you. Nothing else matters.
But we can run away.

1001
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:36,880
Everything will take care of itself.
Please, Peter...

1002
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:40,120
...I can't let you out of my life now.

1003
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:43,640
I couldn't live without you.

1004
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:58,840
You'd better go back to your bed.

1005
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,200
I'm sorry.

1006
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:49,080
Did you mean that? Would you really go?

1007
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:30,480
All I'm asking is enough gas
to get me to New York.

1008
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,080
That bag's worth $25.

1009
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,880
I got a bag. I got one for Christmas...

1010
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:37,440
Here's what I'll do.
I'll come back in the morning...

1011
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,600
...and buy it back from you
with a $10 profit.

1012
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:41,880
- What do you say?
- I ain't got a hat.

1013
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,080
- What?
- I ain't got a hat.

1014
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:47,160
Well, you got one now.
Come on, fill her up.

1015
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:57,760
Where you been all this time?
Everybody's been asking about you.

1016
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:01,480
Get me one drink.
Nobody disturbs me for the next half hour.

1017
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,720
Sure, boss.

1018
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,440
Hello, Agnes.

1019
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:09,800
- Don't. He'll shoot you on sight.
- Haven't been shot at in days.

1020
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:12,680
- Get out of here! Get out!
- Now listen, Joe.

1021
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:13,720
Don't "Joe" me.

1022
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,200
All right, Joe. Listen.

1023
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,680
You know I've always liked you.

1024
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:19,200
Anytime I could help you,
ran across a good story...

1025
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:22,160
...I came running to you with it.
I got one now.

1026
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,720
The wires were on the level.
The biggest scoop ever.

1027
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,480
- It's yours.
- About the Andrews kid?

1028
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,880
I've got it all written up, ready to go.
All I want is a $1,000.

1029
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,600
A $1,000? Get out of here before...

1030
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,680
Don't get sore. You gotta do this for me.

1031
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,200
I need a $1,000 and I need it quick.
I'm in a jam.

1032
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:37,880
What's the $1,000 for?

1033
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,520
To tear down the walls of Jericho.

1034
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,320
Never mind. If I told you that...

1035
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,400
...Ellen Andrews will annul her marriage?

1036
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:45,400
- She'll marry somebody else.
- You're drunk.

1037
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:47,320
Would such a story
be worth $1,000 to you?

1038
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:50,120
- If it was on the level.
- I got it, Joe.

1039
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:55,240
- Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
- I am.

1040
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,440
- You?
- Yes.

1041
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:01,640
Now I know you're drunk. I'm going home.
Don't annoy me anymore.

1042
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:04,160
For heaven sakes!
Stop being an editor for a minute.

1043
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:06,840
We know each other.
You ought to know when I'm serious.

1044
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:09,520
This is on the level.
I met her on a bus from Miami.

1045
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,120
I've been with her every minute.
I'm in love with her.

1046
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,720
You gotta get me this money now, quick.
Minutes count.

1047
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,840
She's waiting for me outside Philadelphia.

1048
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:19,840
I gotta get right back.
She doesn't even know I'm gone.

1049
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:23,200
A guy can't propose to a gal
without a cent in the world, can he?

1050
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:27,480
What a story. On her way
to join husband, Ellen Andrews...

1051
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,000
That's it.

1052
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,480
Let me see that a minute.

1053
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,120
Zeke!

1054
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:42,440
I told you, you couldn't trust him.
He's gone.

1055
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:43,440
Who?

1056
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,200
The fella who was gonna stay a week.
He skipped and took the car with him, too.

1057
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:50,440
We wouldn't have known till morning
if I hadn't took that magnesia.

1058
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:53,200
Get up, don't lay there.
Let's do something about it.

1059
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:56,400
There ain't nothing we can do if he's gone.

1060
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,440
See that? They're gone.

1061
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:14,600
Looks like it, don't it? What's this?

1062
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:18,040
Ma! Here's the woman.

1063
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,800
- What's the matter?
- Where's your husband?

1064
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,840
- Husband?
- Yes, if he is your husband.

1065
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:28,760
- Isn't he here?
- No, he ain't. The car's gone, too.

1066
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:32,400
You got any money?

1067
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,640
- No.
- Then you'll have to git!

1068
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:36,440
Yeah. You'll have to git.

1069
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41,880
Please, may I use your phone?
I've got to call New York.

1070
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:43,960
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone call.

1071
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:48,240
Go to the sheriff's office, a quarter
mile down the road. They'll fix you up.

1072
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:54,240
And listen, next time you better not come
back here. I run a respectable place.

1073
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:01,120
- Thanks, you saved my life.
- Okay. So long kid and good luck.

1074
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:05,120
Goodbye. You're beautiful.
All women are beautiful.

1075
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:08,600
For my dough, he's still the best
newspaper man in the business.

1076
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:11,240
Get Hank, quick. Boy, what a yarn.

1077
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,080
Hold up the morning edition.

1078
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:15,720
Break down the front page.
We'll have a new layout.

1079
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:19,440
Send in a couple of rewrite men.
And Hank, listen. Don't do a thing.

1080
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:23,600
I've got a story that'll make your hair curl.
Wait a minute. Don't annoy me, I'm busy.

1081
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:27,920
Agnes, send Mike in here! Dig up
all the pictures on that Andrews kid.

1082
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,400
And Hank, listen, get Haley out of bed.
I want a cartoon and I want it quick.

1083
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,040
Westley's in it.
He's waiting at the church...

1084
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,960
...with tears on his face.
The bride didn't show up.

1085
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,160
Old Man Andrews is laughing his head off.

1086
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:43,800
Everything exaggerated.
Snap into it. What is it?

1087
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,320
Ellen Andrews? You're crazy.

1088
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:52,040
I'm not. She phoned her father
from an auto camp asking him to come.

1089
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:55,040
He's getting a police escort
and Westley's going along.

1090
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,480
Yes, she's been travelling by bus.

1091
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:00,440
When she found out her father
and Westley made up, she phoned.

1092
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:04,120
Okay, grab a car and stay with them.
Get Hank again.

1093
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:07,200
Agnes, get me a doctor,
I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown.

1094
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,680
Hank, forget what I told you.
I'm having a nightmare.

1095
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:13,280
Agnes, you call the police department.
Tell them to find Peter Warne.

1096
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,040
Send out a general alarm.
I want that dirty crook pinched.

1097
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:16,920
You want us?

1098
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,040
Change the front page!
Ellen Andrews just phoned her father.

1099
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:22,960
She's going home. She found
out Dad withdrew his objections.

1100
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,520
She gave herself up.
Spread it all over the place!

1101
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:29,240
Play it up big! Major league!
"Love Triumphant." Go on, hop to it.

1102
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,360
Okay.

1103
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,680
Come on, baby.
We gotta get there before she wakes up.

1104
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:01,280
Can't you drive any faster?

1105
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:09,880
"Young people in love are never hungry"

1106
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:21,640
Come on, baby. We've got a police escort.

1107
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:35,160
Come on, baby.
They can't make a sucker out of us.

1108
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:41,920
All right, come on.
Step back. Give them room.

1109
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,720
Come on, step back.

1110
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,840
How about a picture for the paper,
Mr. Andrews?

1111
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,800
Wait till she gets home.
Later, boys. Later.

1112
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:04,360
"He floats through the air
with the greatest of ease

1113
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:08,640
"The daring young man
on the flying trapeze"

1114
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,360
Get that thing out of the way!

1115
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:27,200
Keep your britches on, we'll get it out.

1116
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,560
Hey, you darn fool!

1117
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:57,320
Ellen Andrews is going to marry
that Westley guy again.

1118
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:07,760
Gordon's out back some place.

1119
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:11,520
When he comes in, give him this.
Tell him I was just kidding.

1120
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,760
- You can't get a thing done around here.
- Peter was just in.

1121
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,200
- What?
- He left this money.

1122
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,480
- He said he was just kidding.
- Where is he?

1123
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,480
- There he goes.
- Hey, Pete!

1124
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:31,160
Hello. I'm sorry, it was just a little gag.
I thought I'd have some fun with you.

1125
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:34,000
Yeah, sure you had me going
for a little while, too.

1126
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,920
- It wouldn't have made a bad story at that.
- No, great.

1127
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,160
But that's the way things go.
You think you've got a great yarn...

1128
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:44,840
...and then something comes along and
messes up the finish. And there you are.

1129
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,120
Yeah. Where am I?

1130
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:56,240
When you sober up,
come in and talk to me.

1131
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:58,400
Thanks.

1132
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:23,800
Ellie?

1133
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:25,600
Hello, Dad.

1134
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:27,280
I knocked several times.

1135
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:30,800
I'm sorry. I must have been daydreaming.

1136
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:34,800
Everything's set.
Creating quite a furore, too.

1137
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,480
Great stunt King is going to pull.

1138
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:39,000
Stunt?

1139
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:41,200
Yeah, he's landing on the lawn
in an autogyro.

1140
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:45,920
Yes, I heard.

1141
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,920
Personally, I think it's silly, too.

1142
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,920
You look lovely, child.

1143
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,920
Are you pleased with the gown?

1144
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,120
Ellie?

1145
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:00,240
The gown. Yes, it's nice, isn't it?

1146
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:07,840
What's the matter, child?

1147
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:12,120
What's wrong?

1148
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:13,360
Nothing.

1149
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,480
You haven't changed your mind
about King have you?

1150
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:17,640
No.

1151
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:22,000
Because if you have, it isn't too late.
You know how I feel about him.

1152
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:25,320
Well, you gave me such a scare
when I couldn't find you.

1153
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:28,200
You know,
the old pump isn't what it used to be.

1154
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:33,080
I'm sorry, Father. I wouldn't hurt you
for anything in the world. You know that.

1155
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:34,920
What's the matter, child?

1156
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:37,520
Aren't you happy?

1157
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,240
I thought so.

1158
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:45,400
I knew there was something on your mind.

1159
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:49,040
There, now.

1160
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:52,680
What's the matter?

1161
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:57,320
You haven't fallen in love
with someone else, have you?

1162
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:00,440
Have you?

1163
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:06,600
I haven't seen you cry
since you were a baby.

1164
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:09,760
This must be serious.

1165
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:12,600
Where'd you meet him?

1166
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:15,960
On the road.

1167
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:19,000
Now don't tell me you've fallen in love
with a bus driver?

1168
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,360
Oh, no.

1169
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,040
Who is he?

1170
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,520
I don't know very much about him.

1171
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,280
Except that I love him.

1172
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:35,640
If it's as serious as all that,
we'll move heaven and earth to...

1173
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:39,000
No, it's no use. He despises me.

1174
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:40,280
Come now.

1175
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:43,320
Yes, he does.
He despises everything about me.

1176
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:49,240
He says that I'm spoiled and selfish
and pampered and thoroughly insincere.

1177
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:50,960
Ridiculous.

1178
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,800
He doesn't think so much of you, either.

1179
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:54,880
Well, l...

1180
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:57,760
And he blames you for everything
that's wrong with me.

1181
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,480
He says you raised me stupidly.

1182
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,760
And now that's a fine man
to fall in love with.

1183
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:05,880
He's marvellous.

1184
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:09,160
What are we going to do about it?
Where is he?

1185
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:13,040
- I don't know.
- I'd like to have a talk with him.

1186
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:17,160
It wouldn't do any good.
I practically threw myself at him.

1187
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:21,600
Under the circumstances, don't you think
we'd better call this thing off?

1188
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:24,440
No, I'll go through with it.

1189
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:27,360
But that's silly.
Seeing the way you feel about him.

1190
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:30,560
No, it doesn't matter.
I don't want to stir up any more trouble.

1191
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,840
I've done it all my life.

1192
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:36,280
I've made your life miserable.
And mine, too.

1193
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:42,200
I'm tired, father. I'm tired
of running around in circles.

1194
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:46,520
He's right, that's what I've been doing
ever since I can remember.

1195
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:49,000
I've got to settle down.

1196
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:52,920
It doesn't matter how,
where, or with whom.

1197
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:57,120
You've changed, Ellie.

1198
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:02,240
I can't walk out on King now.
It would make us all look so ridiculous.

1199
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:06,280
Anyway, what difference does it make?

1200
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:09,320
I'll never see Peter again.

1201
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:11,200
Is that his name?

1202
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,400
Peter Warne.

1203
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:17,200
Peter Warne.

1204
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:21,360
Why, do you know him?

1205
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:23,040
Why, no.

1206
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:25,800
Father, you haven't heard from him,
have you?

1207
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,920
- Don't be silly, of course.
- Please, what's that?

1208
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:45,040
I guess that was his only interest in me,
wasn't it?

1209
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:48,120
- The reward.
- I'm sorry you read it.

1210
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:51,080
- Are you going to see him?
- I suppose so.

1211
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:56,000
Certainly. Pay him off. He's entitled to it.
He did an excellent job.

1212
01:29:56,360 --> 01:30:00,440
He kept me thoroughly entertained.
It's worth every penny he gets.

1213
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:03,360
Thank you, Mary.
That's just what I needed.

1214
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:05,520
Mr. Westley's on his way up.

1215
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:07,320
Fine, have him come in.

1216
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:15,280
I'll be going.

1217
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:29,360
If it isn't the bridegroom himself.
You're just in time, King.

1218
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:30,800
How are you, Ellie?

1219
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:32,480
You happy?

1220
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:35,000
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy?

1221
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,360
Here we are, let's drink.

1222
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:40,640
It's up to you now.
I want our life to be full of excitement.

1223
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:43,880
We'll never let up, will we?
Never a dull moment.

1224
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,400
We'll get on a merry-go-round
and never get off.

1225
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:51,080
- Promise you'll never let me get off.
- Whatever you say, darling. It's a promise.

1226
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:09,120
Yeah. Who?

1227
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:13,240
Why can't I see you at your office?

1228
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:16,800
I'm leaving for Washington tonight.
I may be gone several weeks.

1229
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:19,920
I thought, perhaps,
you'd like to get this thing settled.

1230
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:23,440
Yeah. But I don't like the idea
of butting in on your jamboree.

1231
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,080
Between you and me,
those things give me a stiff pain.

1232
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:29,320
You don't have to see anybody.
You can come directly to my study.

1233
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:31,840
No. Why do I wanna...

1234
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:39,040
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I will come over. Yeah.

1235
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:42,400
I'd like to get a load of
that three ring circus you're pulling.

1236
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:45,000
I wanna see what love looks like
when it's triumphant.

1237
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:47,240
I haven't had a good laugh in a week.

1238
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:50,720
Mr. Warne?

1239
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:51,920
Yeah.

1240
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,840
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

1241
01:31:57,200 --> 01:32:00,960
I was surprised to get your note.
My daughter hadn't told me anything...

1242
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,960
...about you. About your helping her.

1243
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:06,040
That's typical of your daughter.
Takes those things for granted.

1244
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:08,560
Why did she think
I lugged her from Miami?

1245
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:11,320
She thinks you're entitled
to anything you can get.

1246
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:15,480
She does? Isn't that sweet of her?
You don't, I suppose.

1247
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:19,880
Well, I don't know. I'll have to see
on what you base your claim.

1248
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:21,760
I presume you feel justified.

1249
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:25,160
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.
I got it all itemised.

1250
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:32,520
"Cash outlay, $8.60. Top coat, $15.

1251
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:35,240
"Suitcase, $7.50. Hat, $4.

1252
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:40,920
"Three shirts, $4.50. Total, $39.60.

1253
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:44,360
"All of the above items had
to be sold to buy gasoline."

1254
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:47,400
And I sold some shorts and socks, too.
I'm throwing those in.

1255
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:50,680
- Yes, I know.
- What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough?

1256
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,480
Trip like that'd cost you a $1,000,
maybe more.

1257
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:58,560
Now, let me get this straight. You want
$39.60 in addition to the $10,000?

1258
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:00,480
What 10,000?

1259
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:02,280
The reward.

1260
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,320
Who said anything about a reward?

1261
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:08,120
I'm afraid I'm a little bit confused.
I assumed...

1262
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:12,520
All I want is $39.60. If you give
me a check for it, I'll get out of this joint.

1263
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:14,320
It gives me the jitters.

1264
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:18,160
- You're a peculiar chap.
- We'll go into that some other time.

1265
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:20,880
The average man would go
after the reward.

1266
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:23,240
Did anybody ever make
a sucker out of you?

1267
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:26,240
It's a matter of principle.
You probably wouldn't understand.

1268
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:30,040
When anybody takes me for a buggy ride,
I don't like paying for the privilege.

1269
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:31,960
Were you taken for a buggy ride?

1270
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:35,800
Yes. With all the trimmings.
So how about the check, do I get it?

1271
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:38,240
- Certainly.
- Thanks.

1272
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,600
Here you are.

1273
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,080
Thank you.

1274
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:59,320
Do you mind if I ask you a question,
frankly?

1275
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:01,560
Do you love my daughter?

1276
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:05,760
Any guy in love with your daughter
should be examined.

1277
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:07,160
Now that's an evasion.

1278
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:11,280
She picked herself a perfect running mate,
King Westley. The pill of the century.

1279
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:15,320
She needs a guy that'd sock her once
a day whether it's coming to her or not.

1280
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:18,320
If you were wiser,
you'd have done it yourself long ago.

1281
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:19,560
Do you love her?

1282
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:22,600
A normal man couldn't live
with her without going nutty.

1283
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:24,000
She's my idea of nothing.

1284
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:26,320
I asked you a simple question!
Do you love her?

1285
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:30,400
Yes! Now don't hold that against me!
I'm a little screwy myself!

1286
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:35,320
Here's to the merry-go-round.

1287
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:43,880
Perfect. Now you look natural.

1288
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:51,720
- I hope you got your money.
- You bet I did.

1289
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:54,240
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. Same to you.

1290
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:57,760
Stay around and watch the fun.
You'll enjoy it immensely.

1291
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:00,120
I would, but I've got a weak stomach.

1292
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:08,920
- I just had a long talk with him.
- I'm not interested.

1293
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,280
Now just a minute, Ellie.

1294
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:12,880
I don't want to hear
another word about him.

1295
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:27,760
Come on, folks. King Westley has arrived.

1296
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,800
Here they come, boys. Turn them over.

1297
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:51,400
You're a sucker to go through with this.

1298
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:54,760
That guy, Warne, is okay.

1299
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:59,200
He didn't want the reward.
All he asked for was $39.60.

1300
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:02,600
It's what he spent on you.
Said it was a matter of principle.

1301
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:04,560
You took him for a ride.

1302
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:14,400
He loves you, Ellie. He told me so.

1303
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:19,720
You don't want to be married
to a mug like Westley.

1304
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:22,320
I can buy him off for a pot of gold.

1305
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:28,400
And you can make an old man happy.

1306
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:31,040
And you won't do so bad for yourself.

1307
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:34,440
If you change your mind,
your car's waiting at the back gate.

1308
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:48,440
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together
here in the sight of God...

1309
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:52,160
...and in the face of this company,
to join together this man and this woman...

1310
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:56,480
...in holy matrimony. If any man can show
just cause why they may not lawfully...

1311
01:37:56,560 --> 01:38:01,560
...be joined together, let him now speak
or else, hereafter forever, hold his peace.

1312
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:08,920
King, will thou have this woman to thy
wedded wife so long as you both shall live?

1313
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:10,360
I will.

1314
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:14,960
Ellen, will thou have this man
to thy wedded husband...

1315
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:17,240
...so long as you both shall live?

1316
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,800
Ellen!

1317
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,440
Ellie!

1318
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:54,480
What happened?

1319
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,600
I haven't the slightest idea.

1320
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:14,720
Don't want to talk to you.
Don't want to talk to anybody.

1321
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:16,320
Don't want to see anybody.

1322
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:18,160
But it's King Westley on the phone.

1323
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:27,440
Hello, my would be ex-son-in-law.
I've sent you a check for $100,000.

1324
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:32,320
That's the smartest thing you ever did,
Westley, not to contest that annulment.

1325
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:36,160
That's satisfactory, isn't it? It ought to be.

1326
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:40,560
I'm not complaining.
Not complaining. It was dirt-cheap.

1327
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:43,880
Don't fall out of any windows!

1328
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:48,320
There's another wire from Peter.
They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.

1329
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:52,320
"What's holding up the annulment,
you slowpoke.

1330
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:55,640
"The walls of Jericho are toppling."

1331
01:39:57,160 --> 01:40:01,600
Send him a telegram right away.
Just say, "Let them topple."

1332
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:06,560
- Funny couple, ain't they?
- Yeah.

1333
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:08,920
If you ask me,
I don't believe they're married.

1334
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,400
They're married, all right.
I just seen the license.

1335
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:15,360
They made me get them a rope
and a blanket, on a night like this.

1336
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:16,800
What do you reckon that's for?

1337
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:19,360
Blamed if I know.
I just brought them a trumpet.

1338
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:20,480
A trumpet?

1339
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:22,920
A toy. They sent me to the store to get it.

1340
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,280
What in the world do they want
a trumpet for?

1341
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:26,480
Don't know.
